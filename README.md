# sketchy-etcher

A project from The Odin Project to make an etch-a-sketch.

I focused on trying to make the webpage "serendipitous" with no clutter and just be a fun little drawing experience. I had a design in mind of an entire webpage being a canvas with a "zen mode" type of feel that removes all distracting menu elements, so i landed on a popupmenu that opens and closes upon right clicking.

I am quite pleased with the design, however, it is NOT meant for mobile.

Written in pure HTML, CSS and Javascript.
